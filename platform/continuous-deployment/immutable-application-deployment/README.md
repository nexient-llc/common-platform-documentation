# Immutable Application Deployments

Immutable application deployments refer to the practice of never altering or updating the deployed software components in a live environment. Instead, any changes are introduced through the deployment of a new version of the application in a separate execution context (namespace, cloud resource, etc.) with users transitioned to the newly deployed version with a canary or blue/green strategy.

## Benefits of Immutable Deployments

**Consistency:** Immutable deployments ensure that the application environment remains consistent across different stages of the deployment pipeline. This reduces the risk of encountering unexpected behavior due to differences in the environment.

**Reliability:** By replacing entire deployments instead of updating them, you eliminate the risk of partial updates or failed rollbacks. If a new deployment fails, you can simply redirect traffic back to the previous version.

**Simplicity:** Immutable deployments simplify the deployment process. There's no need to manage updates or rollbacks, just deploy the new version and remove the old one.

**Scalability:** Immutable deployments are highly scalable. New instances of the application can be quickly spun up since they are simply clones of the existing deployment.

## Challenges of Immutable Deployments

**Storage:** Immutable deployments can lead to increased storage requirements, as each deployment requires a full copy of the application.

**Speed:** Deploying a full application can take longer than updating an existing one, potentially leading to slower release cycles.

**Database Migrations:** Immutable deployments can complicate database migrations, as the database cannot be updated in the same way as the application. Database migrations are discussed in depth in [Continuous Database Deployment](../evolutionary-database-deployment/README.md).

**Configuration Management:** Each deployment may require its own configuration, leading to increased complexity in configuration management. Effort should be made to limit this complication, but conditions may exist where it is difficult to avoid. Configurations should be versioned in coordination with their corresponding deployments.

## Best Practices for Implementing Immutable Deployments

**Containerization:** Use containerization technologies to package your application and its dependencies into a single, immutable unit.

**Configuration Management:** Store configuration separately from your application, such as in environment variables or external configuration services. This allows you to change the configuration without changing the application itself. These configuration sets should be versionable with the ability to correlate a configuration version with a deployment or application version.

**Automate Deployments:** Use automation tools to automate the process of deploying your application. This reduces the risk of human error and ensures that every deployment is consistent.

**Version Control:** Keep track of all versions of your application. This allows you to quickly roll back to a previous version if something goes wrong.

**Health Checks:** Implement health checks at all levels of the application to monitor your application. Health checks should only check "local" health and not "reach through" to attempt to do end-to-end health monitoring. End-to-end testing at this level is likely to create cascading failures and create ambiguous signals to incident responders. End-to-end testing should be implemented by an external availability monitor. Creating appropriate health checks at each level of the application architecture enables the system to perform some level of self-healing and allows SRE and incident response resources to have a better understanding of the state of the application should an incident arise.

**Blue/Green Deployment:** Use blue/green deployment strategies to minimize downtime and risk. This involves having two environments (blue and green) and switching traffic between them when deploying new versions.

**Monitoring and Logging:** Implement robust monitoring and logging to track the performance and behavior of your application. Logging and Metrics should be accessible to SRE and Incident Response resources via a "single pane of glass". Additionally, the monitoring platform should have some ability to corroborate log data and metric data.

## Popular Tools for Implementing Immutable Deployments

A list of tools that are useful when implementing Continuous Deployment is included below. This is not a comprehensive list, nor is it meant to endorse any of these tools. Many more tools exist and some tools will work better than others in any given project. You are encouraged to understand the requirements of your project and find the best tool for the job. 

**Docker:** A platform that enables developers to automate the deployment, scaling, and management of applications within containers.

**Kubernetes:** An open-source platform designed to automate deploying, scaling, and operating application containers.

**Terraform:** An Infrastructure as Code (IaC) tool for building, changing, and versioning infrastructure safely and efficiently.

**Ansible:** An open-source software provisioning, configuration management, and application-deployment tool.

**Jenkins:** An open-source automation server that enables developers to reliably build, test, and deploy their software.

**Git:** A distributed version control system for tracking changes in source code during software development.

**AWS EC2:** A web service that provides secure, resizable compute capacity in the cloud. It is designed to make web-scale cloud computing easier for developers.

**Google Cloud Platform (GCP):** Offers services in computing, storage, and application development that run on Google hardware.

**Azure:** Microsoft's public cloud computing platform that provides a range of cloud services, including those for computing, analytics, storage, and networking.

**Helm:** A package manager for Kubernetes that allows developers and operators to more easily package, configure, and deploy applications and services onto Kubernetes clusters.

**Prometheus:** An open-source systems monitoring and alerting toolkit.

**ELK Stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana):** Open source tools that together provide real time monitoring and analysis of data.
